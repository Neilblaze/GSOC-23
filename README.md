This project aims to test and demonstrate the capabilities of the new MediaPipe [Hand Landmarker](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/api/solutions/js/tasks-vision.handlandmarker) task from MediaPipe Solutions, which outputs 21 hand landmarks. The task provides precise and accurate hand landmark detection, generating [21](https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/solutions/vision/hand_landmarker#models) key points on the hand. These landmarks are utilized in this interactive web app which enables users to perform contactless interactions with the interface using simple human gestures. Best experienced in well-lit environments. Ideal on larger screens.
